Settings
========

Waliki follows a `convention over configuration <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration>`_
paradigm, defining sensible defaults for every constant.

For now, look in `waliki/settings.py <https://github.com/mgaitan/waliki/blob/master/waliki/settings.py>`_
to see a list of available settings.

You can override any setting in your project's ``settings.py``
