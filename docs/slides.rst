Plugin "View as slides"
=======================

This plugin leverages on Hovercraft_ to view a page as a presentation.
It only works for restructuredText)

It registers a new :ref:`extra_page_action view <write_plugin>` in the dropdown menu as *"View as slides"*. For obvious reasons, it only appears in reStructuredText pages.

To install it, add ``'waliki.slides'`` after ``'waliki'`` in your ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``.
